/**
 * @addtogroup LayersGroup
 * @details The display of the image by the PicoVGA library is performed by the PIO processor controller. PIO0 is used. 
 * The other controller, PIO1, is unused and can be used for other purposes. PIO0 contains a 4 state machines, SM0 to SM3. 
 * All PIO0 state machines use a common program of 32 instructions. Each state machine serves 1 overlay layer. SM0 services 
 * base layer 0, along with servicing the synchronization signal. The base layer service program consists of 15 instructions, 
 * starting at offset 17. This part of the program is immutable and is always used. However, the other 3 layers, 1 to 3, SM1 to SM3, 
 * use the other part of the program memory, 17 instructions starting at address 0. This part may change, depending on the mode 
 * of the overlay layers. All 3 overlay layers use a common program and must therefore operate in the same display mode. Some 
 * overlay modes use the same program and can be shared - see the table below for details.
 * @note Only base layer 0 can contain segments in different formats. Overlay layers 1 to 3 are independent of the base layer 
 * format, sharing only the total display area with the base layer, but using their own image format, for which only the 
 * coordinates and dimensions are specified. 
 * 
 * <h3>Overlay layers can use one of the following programs:</h3>
 * * <b>LAYERPROG_BASE</b> - The base layer 0 program. Cannot be used for overlay layers. Using the parameter 
 * for an overlay layer means that the layer is inactive (not using the program).
 * * <b>LAYERPROG_KEY</b> - Layer with key color. The specified color is replaced by transparency.
 * * <b>LAYERPROG_BLACK</b> - Transparency with black color. Black is replaced by transparency. Compared to the previous mode, 
 * the advantage is less demanding on processor speed.
 * * <b>LAYERPROG_WHITE</b> - transparency with white colour. It is faster like the previous function and is suitable for use
 * where black needs to be preserved but white can be omitted. When preparing the image, the image is not copied from Flash to 
 * RAM with the memcpy function, but the CopyWhiteImg() function is used. The function ensures that the pixels of the copied 
 * image are incremented by 1. This changes the white color (with a value of 255) to black (with a value of 0). From this point 
 * on, the image is treated as if it had transparency with black - e.g. the black color is specified for the sprite rendering 
 * function. Only when the image enters the program in PIO0, the program makes the pixel transparent as in the case of black, 
 * but at the same time decrements the pixel value. This reverts the colors back to the original value, the black color becomes 
 * black and the white color has been used as transparency.
 * * <b>LAYERPROG_MONO</b> - This programme includes 2 sub-programmes. The first is the display of a monochrome image. For each 
 * bit of image data, either the selected image color is displayed or the corresponding pixel is transparent. This mode is used 
 * in the Oscilloscope example to display a grid across the oscilloscope screen. The second subroutine is to display a color 
 * image without transparency. The color pixels are displayed as they are, with no transparency option, but the dimensions of 
 * the image rectangle and its coordinate on the display can be defined. Thus, a sort of analogy of a single rectangular sprite 
 * without transparency.
 * * <b>LAYERPROG_RLE</b> - RLE compression mode. RLE compression is not a universally valid format. It means that the data 
 * contains segment length information. In this case, the image data of PicoVGA library contain directly instructions for the 
 * PIO program. More specifically, the image data is interleaved with the jump addresses inside the program. The image is 
 * prepared using the RaspPicoRle program and is strongly coupled to the layer program used. If, for example, the instructions 
 * in the program were shifted, the RLE compression format would stop working. This is also why the program for base layer 0 
 * is placed at the end of the program memory and the overlay layer programs at the beginning - to reduce the chance that 
 * changes in the program will change the location of the program in memory, at which point RLE compression would stop working. 
 * After modifying the RLE program in PIO, the conversion program must also be updated.
 * 
 * The desired mode of each overlay layer is specified in the video mode definition using the VgaCfg() function. The layer mode 
 * is used to derive the program and function used to operate the layer rendering. Multiple layer modes can share the same 
 * program type. Layer modes have different state machine timing requirements. The configuration function takes this into 
 * account and adjusts the processor frequency accordingly.
 * 
 * <h3>Modes of overlay layers:</h3>
 * 
 * *WHITE modes using white transparent color require image preparation using CopyWhiteImg() as specified for LAYERPROG_WHITE.
 * * <b>LAYERMODE_BASE</b> - Indicates base layer mode 0. Cannot be used for an overlay layer, but is used to indicate an inactive 
 * disabled overlay layer.
 * * <b>LAYERMODE_KEY</b> - The layer with the specified key color.
 * * <b>LAYERMODE_BLACK</b> - Layer with black key color.
 * * <b>LAYERMODE_WHITE</b> - Layer with white key color.
 * * <b>LAYERMODE_MONO</b> - Monochromatic image.
 * * <b>LAYERMODE_COLOR</b> - Colour image (without transparency).
 * * <b>LAYERMODE_RLE</b> - Image with RLE compression.
 * * <b>LAYERMODE_SPRITEKEY</b> - Sprays with the specified key color.
 * * <b>LAYERMODE_SPRITEBLACK</b> - Sprays with black key color.
 * * <b>LAYERMODE_SPRITEWHITE</b> - Sprays with white key color.
 * * <b>LAYERMODE_FASTSPRITEKEY</b> - Fast sprites with the specified key colour.
 * * <b>LAYERMODE_FASTSPRITEBLACK</b> - Fast sprites with black key colour.
 * * <b>LAYERMODE_FASTSPRITEWHITE</b> - Fast sprites with white key colour.
 * * <b>LAYERMODE_PERSPKEY</b> - Image with transformation matrix with specified key color.
 * * <b>LAYERMODE_PERSPBLACK</b> - Image with transformation matrix with black key color.
 * * <b>LAYERMODE_PERSPWHITE</b> - Image with transformation matrix with white key color.
 * * <b>LAYERMODE_PERSP2KEY</b> - Image with transformation matrix with specified key color and doubled width.
 * * <b>LAYERMODE_PERSP2BLACK</b> - Image with transformation matrix with black key color and doubled width.
 * * <b>LAYERMODE_PERSP2WHITE</b> - Image with transformation matrix with white key color and doubled width.
 * 
 * <h3>Shared overlay modes</h3>
 *
 * Layer modes can only be combined together if they use the same program. CPP is the minimum required number of SMx clock
 * cycles per pixel.

 * 
 * <h3>Selection of write planes</h3>
 * 
 * By default, the image is output from the layers to all output pins. This can be changed by redefining the LayerFirstPin 
 * and LayerNumPin fields (in vga_layer.cpp). It is possible to specify for each layer separately which output pins will 
 * be written to. This can create a kind of pseudo-transparency. For example, one layer will render curves in red, another 
 * layer in green, and the colors will blend independently. When redefining the pins, however, you must take into account 
 * that the offset of the pin mapping will shift. The output will always start from the lowest bits of the pixel.
 * 
 * <h3>Configure overlay layers</h3>
 * 
 * The first step for setting up the overlay layer is to specify the layer mode for the VgaCfg() initialization function. 
 * The function detects the required program and the required timing. It does not check if the correct layer modes are 
 * combined together.
 *
 * The second step is to initialize the layer descriptor - the sLayer structure in the LayerScreen field. It is convenient 
 * to use the LayerSetup() initialization function for this.

/**
 * @addtogroup SpriteGroup
 * @details Sprites can be used in overlay planes with KEY, BLACK and WHITE programs. There are two ways to use the sprites:
 * 
 * 1. Slow sprites, LAYERMODE_SPRITE* modes. Sprites are software generated. The line rendering function first clears the line 
 * buffer with a transparent color and then sequentially passes through the array of sprites. It looks for which sprites overlap 
 * a given Y address and, if so, renders the line into the buffer. Sprites in this mode have the advantage that they can overlap 
 * arbitrarily (the order of overlapping is based on the order of location in the address array) and can scroll subtly pixel by 
 * pixel. The main disadvantage is the high rendering overhead. Even a small number of sprites can cause a line rendering time
 * overflow and thus an video dropout. However, it is important to note that the number of sprites (and their dimensions) on the 
 * same video line is involved. Sprites at distant Y-coordinates are not affected. To check if the rendering function will 
 * handle a given number of sprites, place the sprites horizontally next to each other. Conversely, if you want to ensure low 
 * rendering requirements, ensure that the sprites are not in the same vertical Y coordinates. Or reduce the width of the sprites.
 * 
 * 2. Fast sprites, LAYERMODE_FASTSPRITE* modes. Sprites are not software rendered to the render buffer, but are sent directly to 
 * PIO via DMA transfer. This makes the rendering of sprites very fast and allows multiple sprites to be displayed side by side. 
 * Of course, this brings disadvantages on the other side. The X-coordinate of the sprites and their width must be a multiple of 4,
 * and the sprites cannot be scrolled finely on the screen (does not apply to the Y-coordinate). But most importantly, the sprites 
 * cannot directly overlap. One sprite can continue rendering where the previous sprite left off. Thus, the previous sprite can cut
 * off the beginning of the next sprite. There is a treatment that can slightly improve the situation. To improve overlays (and 
 * speed up rendering), the sprite includes a table that indicates how many pixels from the edge the opaque sprite line starts 
 * and how long it is. The SpritePrepLines() function can be used to generate the table. For fast sprites, this information must be 
 * a multiple of 4. Thus, if we ensure that the beginnings and ends of the image lines start and end at multiples of 4, the 
 * sprites will overlap almost correctly (unless they have internal transparency). Otherwise, transparent holes may appear at 
 * the point of overlap. One of the requirements for fast sprites is that the list of sprites must be sorted by the X coordinate. 
 * The SortSprite() support function is used for this purpose.
 * 
 * When using sprites, the first step will be to specify the LAYERMODE_*SPRITE* layer mode for the VgaCfg() initialization 
 * function.
 * 
 * The second step will be to build an array of sprite pattern line starts and lengths using the SpritePrepLines() function. 
 * The function will be passed a pointer to the image of each sprite (only 8-bit sprites are supported), the image dimensions, 
 * the pointers to the array of origin and line lengths (the array dimensions correspond to the height of the sprite), and the 
 * key transparency color. The function searches for line starts and line ends and writes them into the fields. The 'fast' 
 * parameter specifies whether the tables are generated for fast sprites, in which case the line starts and lengths are divided 
 * by 4. For slow sprites, the sprite width must be limited to 255 pixels.
 * 
 * The third step is to build a list of sprites and initialize the sprites - especially the pointer to the image, the dimensions 
 * and coordinates of the sprites. The sprite list is an array of pointers to the sprite. Each sprite can only be in the list 
 * once, but multiple sprite can share the same sprite image and the same array of line starts and lengths. Slow sprites can have 
 * coordinates outside the allowed range (they will be cropped), but for fast sprites I recommend not to exceed the horizontal 
 * limits of the screen, the cropping of the image is not yet properly tuned and the program might crash.
 * 
 * While the sprites don't have a parameter to turn them off, they can be turned off by setting the Y coordinate out off screen. 
 * During rendering, visible sprites are searched for by the Y coordinate, an invalid Y coordinate will ensure that the sprite 
 * is safely disabled.
 * 
 * Fast sprites require sorting the list by the X coordinate. This is done by the SortSprite() function, which is passed a pointer 
 * to the list of sprites and the number of sprites in the list. This function should be called whenever you change the X 
 * coordinate of the sprite. Transient conditions (e.g. momentary mis-overlapping of sprites) do not matter, they are just 
 * short-term optical errors, they do not compromise the program. The function sorts using the bubble method, so it is quite 
 * slow, but so far it does not seem to harm anything (there are not many sprays).
 * 
 * The last step is the initialization of the layer with the sprite. The function was described in the previous chapter.
 * 
 * The next step is to turn on layer visibility with LayerOn() and control the sprites by changing their X and Y coordinates and 
 * changing their img images.
