* @brief Defining the layout of the display
* @details When displaying screen image, the default pointer is @link pScreen @endlink for the library. It points to the sScreen structure that 
* describes the contents of the display. The Raspberry Pico has a limited RAM size and cannot accommodate a high resolution image. 
* Therefore, the image must be composed of smaller segments to minimize the memory-intensive parts.
* @note The following descriptions of the image format only apply to the base image layer 0. It is the only one that can contain 
* segments in different formats. Overlay layers 1 through 3 are independent of the base layer format, sharing only the total 
* screen area with the base layer but using their own image format.

 * number of mapwbits and maphbits. Tiles must have a square dimension, which must also be a power of 2. The tile dimension is 
 * specified by the tilebits parameter as the number of dimension bits. The 'tiles' parameter is a pointer to an image with a 
 * pattern of tiles arranged in 1 column of tiles. The 'horizon' parameter specifies the horizon offset over the segment boundary 
 * / 4. A positive number represents the horizon offset, a negative number will invert the perspective (can be used to display
